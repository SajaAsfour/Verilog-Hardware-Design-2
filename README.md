# 🔧 Verilog Hardware Design - Homework 2

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my **Verilog implementation** for **Homework 2** in **Advanced Digital Design (ENCS3310)**. The assignment involves designing and simulating digital circuits based on **state diagrams and structural implementations** using **Verilog HDL**.

## 🛠 Features
- ✅ **Behavioral Verilog Description for a State Diagram (Figure 1)**
- ✅ **Structural Verilog Implementation of Circuit (Figure 2)**
  - Designed using **D Flip-Flops (D-FFs)**
- ✅ **Structural Verilog Implementation of Modified Circuit (Figure 3)**
- ✅ **Testbench for Functional Verification:**
  - Compares the outputs of behavioral and structural models
  - Prints **PASS** if outputs match, otherwise **FAIL**

## 📂 Contents
